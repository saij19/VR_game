##  :sparkles: Wizard's Dungeon Laboratory :sparkles:
The goal of our project was to create an immersive VR experience where the user can explore a mystical dungeon and experiment with alchemy in a wizard's laboratory.

The user is able to grab ingredients, recipe books and other objects, mix potions and use them to progress, and explore the surrounding rooms.

When all the recipes are completed, the last one will unlock a "treasure room" and the game will be completed. The user has then the option to stay in the current room or restart.

##### :white_check_mark: Main features:

- **Locomotion**: continuous movement, snap turning and head tracking
- **Grabbable objects**: ingredients, books and other objects in the rooms can be grabbed and released using the controllers
- **Socket interaction**: books containing potions recipes can be placed in a socket (reading stand) to be opened
- **Respawnable objects**: all objects placed inside the cauldron will respawn at their original location
- **Visual feedback for potion making**: messages are provided when adding a wrong ingredient or when a recipe is completed. In addition, when a recipe is completed, a new object will spawn, which will be useful to progress in the game.
- **Haptic feedback**: when the user comes in contact with an interactable and when they grab it 
- **Audio effects**: audio feedback is present when the user adds ingredients to the pot, completes a recipe or make an incorrect one 
- **Help Menu**: an help menu, containing audio/haptics/music settings and a restart option, can be accessed by interacting with a help books
